# Student Performance Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes the student performance dataset from Kaggle, focusing on data ingestion, transformation, and model training.

## Features
- Data ingestion from Kaggle API
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Model training using machine learning algorithms
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Configure environment variables.

## Usage
1. Run `python main.py` to start the data processing pipeline.
2. Follow the instructions for model training in `train.ipynb`.

## CI/CD Pipeline
The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Upon pushing to the main branch, tests are automatically run, and on successful builds, deployments are triggered.

## Data Source
The dataset can be found on Kaggle: [Student Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977).
It includes attributes such as student demographics, performance scores, and more.
